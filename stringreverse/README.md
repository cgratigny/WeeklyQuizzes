# Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string, reverse all the words. To clarify, input: `Programming is awesome!` output: `awesome! is Programming`. Consider all consecutive non-whitespace characters as individual words. If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single white space. Also remove all leading and trailing whitespaces. So, the output for "   CS degree", "CS    degree", "CS degree   ", or "   CS   degree   " are all the same: "degree CS".

In this challenge we will use the following string text:

     Have a pick:  twenty six letters  —  no forcing a jumbled quiz! 

Note the extra spaces throughout the string and at the very beginning and end of the string, so please use an assignment such as:

    text = " Have a pick:  twenty six letters  —  no forcing a jumbled quiz! "
